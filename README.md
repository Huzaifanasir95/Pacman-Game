# Pacman-Game
I implemented Pacman Game in Assembly Language
The goal of this project is to implement a classic Pac-Man game using Assembly
language (8086) in Visual Studio. The game will consist of three levels, each with
unique features, challenges, and objectives.
Players embark on their Pac-Man journey with three lives. Losing a life occurs when
Pac-Man collides with a ghost or faces specific challenges within the maze. The
inclusion of lives adds an extra layer of strategy, emphasizing the importance of
careful navigation and strategic use of power pellets. You are required to draw the
levels and the full functionality for the pac man. It includes the movement of the
player the movement of ghost i.e. ai movement. The wall is around the ground it is
shown in images below.
